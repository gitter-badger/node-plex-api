Small module which helps you query the Plex Media Server HTTP API.

## Usage

**PlexAPI(options | hostname)**

Instantiate a PlexAPI client.

The parameter can be a string representing the server's hostname, or an object with the following properties:

Options:
- **hostname**: hostname where Plex Server runs
- **port**: port number Plex Server is listening on (optional, default: 32400)
- **username**: plex.tv username (optional / required for PlexHome)
- **password**: plex.tv password (optional / required for PlexHome)
- **options**: override additional PlexHome options (optional, but recommended for PlexHome)
	- **identifier**: A unique client identifier. Default is a `generated uuid v4`. *Note: you should really provide this rather than let it get generated. Every time your app runs, a new "device" will get registered on your Plex account, which can lead to poor performance once hundreds or thousands of them get created. Trust me!*
	- **product**: The name of your application. Official Plex examples: `Plex Web`, `Plex Home Theater`, `Plex for Xbox One`. Default `Node.js App`
	- **version**: The version of your app. Default `1.0`
	- **deviceName**: The "name" of the device your app is running on. For apps like Plex Home Theater and mobile apps, it's the computer or phone's name chosen by the user. Default `Node.js App`
	- **platform**: The platform your app is running on. The use of this is inconsistent in the official Plex apps. It is not displayed on the web interface. Official Plex examples: `Chrome`, `Plex Home Theater`, `Windows`. Default is `Node.js`.
	- **platformVersion**: The platform version. Default is the version of Node running.
	- **device**: The name of the type of computer your app is running on, usually the OS name. Official Plex examples: `Windows`, `iPhone`, `Xbox One`. Default is whatever `os.platform()` returns.

Here's an example of what an app shows up as on the Plex web interface

![Plex Device Example](docs/plex-device-example.png?raw)

The rows in that example from top to bottom are `deviceName`, `version`, `product`, and `device`.

### .query(uri)

**Retrieve content from URI**

Aside from requesting the API and returning its response, an `.uri` property are created to easier follow the URIs available in the HTTP API. At the moment URIs are attached for Directory and Server items.

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

client.query("/").then(function (result) {
	console.log("%s running Plex Media Server v%s",
		result.friendlyName,
		result.version);

	// array of children, such as Directory or Server items
	// will have the .uri-property attached
	console.log(result._children);
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});
```

### .postQuery(uri)

**Send a POST request and retrieve the response**

This is identical to ```query(uri)```, except that the request will be a POST rather than a GET.

Note that the parameters can only be passed as a query string as part of the uri, which is all Plex requires. (```Content-Length``` will always be zero)

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

client.postQuery("/playQueue?type=video&uri=someuri&shuffle=0'").then(function (result) {
	console.log("Added video to playQueue %s",
		result.playQueueID);

	// array of children, such as Directory or Server items
	// will have the .uri-property attached
	console.log(result._children);
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});
```

### .perform(uri)

**Perform an API action**

When performing an "action" on the HTTP API, the response body will be empty.
As the response content itself is worthless, `perform()` acts on the HTTP status codes the server responds with.

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

// update library section of key "1"
client.perform("/library/sections/1/refresh").then(function () {
	// successfully started to refresh library section #1
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});
```

### .find(uri, [{criterias}]) 

**Find matching child items on URI**

Uses `query()` behind the scenes, giving all directories and servers the beloved `.uri` property.

```js
var PlexAPI = require("plex-api");
var client = new PlexAPI("192.168.0.1");

// filter directories on Directory attributes
client.find("/library/sections", {type: "movie"}).then(function (directories) {
	// directories would be an array of sections whose type are "movie"
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});

// criterias are interpreted as regular expressions
client.find("/library/sections", {type: "movie|shows"}).then(function (directories) {
	// directories type would be "movie" OR "shows"
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});

// shorthand to retrieve all Directories
client.find("/").then(function (directories) {
	// directories would be an array of Directory items
}, function (err) {
	throw new Error("Could not connect to server");
});
```

## Authenticators

An authenticator is used by plex-api to authenticate its request against Plex Servers with a PlexHome setup. The most common authentication mechanism is by username and password.

You can provide your own custom authentication mechanism, read more about custom authenticators below.

### Credentials: username and password

Comes bundled with plex-api. Just provide `options.username` and `options.password` when creating a PlexAPI instance and you are good to go.

See the [plex-api-credentials](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api-credentials) module for more information about its inner workings.

### Custom authenticator

In its simplest form an `authenticator` is an object with **one required** function `authenticate()` which should return the autentication token needed by plex-api to satisfy Plex Server.

An optional method `initialize()` could be implemented if you need reference to the created PlexAPI instance when it's created.

```js
{
  // OPTIONAL
  initialize: function(plexApi) {
    // plexApi === the PlexAPI instance just created
  },
  // REQUIRED
  authenticate: function(plexApi, callback) {
    // plexApi === the PlexAPI instance requesting the authentication token

    // invoke callback if something fails
    if (somethingFailed) {
      return callback(new Error('I haz no cluez about token!'));
    }

    // or when you have a token
    callback(null, 'I-found-this-token');
  }
}
```

## Changelog

### v3.1.1
- Fixing broken authentication blooper by @phillipj

### v3.1.0

- Extensible authentication mechanisms by @phillipj
- Extracted HTTP headers generation into [plex-api-headers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api-headers) for re-use by @phillipj

### v3.0.0
- Change xml2json to xml2js by @OverloadUT

#### BREAKING CHANGE

Some of URIs on the Plex Server responds with XML instead of JSON. Previous versions of plex-api used xml2json to translate between XML to JSON. We have now replaced xml2json with xml2js which might result in a different JSON format when requesting URIs responding with XML.

Please see the documentation of [xml2json](https://github.com/buglabs/node-xml2json) and [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js) for more details about their differences.

### v2.5.0
- Updated the readme to explain each of the X-Plex headers by @OverloadUT
- The X-Plex headers are now sent on every request by @OverloadUT
- Added missing X-Plex headers: deviceName, platformVersion by @OverloadUT
- Updated the default X-Plex headers to be a bit more descriptive by @OverloadUT

### v2.4.0
- Added `postQuery()` to perform POST requests by @OverloadUT

### v2.3.0
- PlexHome authentication if needed when calling `.perform()` as with `.query()`, by @OverloadUT

### v2.2.0
- Convert to JSON or XML according to server response header, or resolve with raw server response buffer. This allows for image buffers to be fetched. By @YouriT

### v2.1.0
- Add ability to define app options by @DMarby

### v2.0.1
- Bugfix for wrong `.uri` in some cases by @pjeby

### v2.0.0
- PlexHome support
- Deprecated port argument of PlexAPI constructor in favor of an options object
- Retrieves JSON from the Plex HTTP API instead of XML **see breaking changes below!**

#### BREAKING CHANGES FROM v1.0.0 AND BELOW

We're now retrieving JSON from the Plex HTTP API instead of XML, which got translated to JSON by this module. Direct consequences:
- Attributes previously found in `result.attributes` are now available directly in `result`
- Child items such as Directory and Server has moved from e.g. `result.directory` to `result._children`

```js
client.query("/").then(function (result) {
	console.log(result.friendlyName); // was result.attributes.friendlyName
	console.log("Directory count:", result._children.length); // was result.directory.length
});
```

### v1.0.0
v1.0.0 mostly to be a better semver citizen and some housekeeping.

### v0.4.2
- Updated dependencies
- Housekeeping with some minor code refactor

### v0.4.1
- Bugfix for not releasing HTTP agent sockets properly on .perform()

### v0.4.0
- Converted all methods to return promises, rather than accepting callback as argument
- Converted buster tests to mocha/expect.js

### v0.2.3
- .find() matches attribute values by regular expression
- Added getters for hostname and port
- Made constructor hostname parameter required

### v0.2.2
- Bugfix for .find() only working when having Directory items

### v0.2.1
- Generalized URI resolving as bugfix for other types of items than Directories
- Added URIs for Server items

### v0.2.0
- **important** Removed explicit XML to JSON conversion to ensure consistent child item names. The main difference for those using previous module versions, is the need to change their use of result.directories to result.directory.
